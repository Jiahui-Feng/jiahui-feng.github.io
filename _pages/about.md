My research focuses on Dynamical Systems, with key research interests in Weak Hyperbolic Theory and its applications. The qualitative theory of mean hyperbolic systems, such as the analytic normalization (Math. Annalen, 2026) and smooth normalization (J. Math. Phys., 2025) based on the mean dichotomy spectrum (Proc. R. Soc. Edinb. A, 2025), has been established. For the chaotic behavior of mean hyperbolic systems, the weak Smale horseshoe with infinite branches (J. Differ. Equ., 2021) provides an interesting insight.

Drawing on these results, my current research interests center on the statistical properties of mean hyperbolic systems (weak hyperbolic horseshoe and billiard systems), and the topological entropy, average Lyapunov exponents in mean hyperbolic settings.
