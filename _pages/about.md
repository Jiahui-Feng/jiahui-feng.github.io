This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!


My research lies primarily in the field of Dynamical Systems, with a specific focus on Hyperbolic Theory and its generalizations. My work aims to bridge the gap between uniform and non-uniform hyperbolicity by investigating Mean Hyperbolic Systems.

I currently investigate the spectral theory of dynamical systems, focusing on the Mean Dichotomy Spectrum and its applications to Analytic Normalization and Reducibility. My recent work has led to new insights into the Hartman-Grobman theorem and the construction of smooth normal forms for weak hyperbolic systems. Looking forward, I am expanding my research to explore the topological entropy of weak hyperbolic systems and the statistical properties of weak horseshoes and billiard systems.
