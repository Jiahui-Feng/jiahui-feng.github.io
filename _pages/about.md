My research lies primarily in the field of Dynamical Systems, with a specific focus on Hyperbolic Theory and its generalizations. My work aims to bridge the gap between uniform and non-uniform hyperbolicity by investigating Mean Hyperbolic Systems.

I currently investigate the spectral theory of dynamical systems, focusing on the Mean Dichotomy Spectrum and its applications to Analytic Normalization and Reducibility. My recent work has led to new insights into the Hartman-Grobman theorem and the construction of smooth normal forms for weak hyperbolic systems. Looking forward, I am expanding my research to explore the topological entropy of weak hyperbolic systems and the statistical properties of weak horseshoes and billiard systems.

My research focuses on the qualitative theory of differential equations and dynamical systems. I am particularly interested in the geometric and ergodic properties of systems exhibiting Mean Hyperbolicity. My work combines techniques from spectral theory, ergodic theory, and smooth dynamics to analyze the stability and structure of complex systems.

My current research achievements can be summarized into three main areas:

1. Normal Forms and Linearization Theory
A significant portion of my work is dedicated to local structure analysis near invariant sets. I have established results regarding Analytic Normalization and the elimination of non-resonant terms using the mean dichotomy spectrum.

Key contribution: I have developed methods for analytic normalization for weak hyperbolic systems (Mathematische Annalen, 2026).
Key contribution: I have investigated the Hartman-Grobman theorem for mean hyperbolic systems, extending classical linearization results to more general settings (DCDS-B, 2025).
2. Spectral Theory and Reducibility
I investigate the spectral characterizations of dynamical stability. My research on the Dichotomy Spectrum provides criteria for the reducibility of mean hyperbolic systems.

By analyzing the mean dichotomy spectrum, I have derived conditions for smooth normal forms (J. Math. Phys., 2025) and explored reducibility problems (Proc. Royal Soc. Edinburgh A, 2025).
3. Ergodic Theory and Hyperbolic Structures
I explore the intersection of topological dynamics and ergodic theory. My work includes the study of Weak Smale Horseshoes and the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) for semi-discrete systems.

Key contribution: I have analyzed the relationship between the weak Smale horseshoe and mean hyperbolicity (JDE, 2021), as well as admissibility for evolution equations (Bull. Sci. Math., 2024).

Building upon my foundation in mean hyperbolicity and spectral theory, my future research will focus on the statistical and topological quantification of chaos in weaker hyperbolic settings:

Topological Entropy of Weak Hyperbolic Systems: I aim to investigate how weak hyperbolicity influences the complexity of a system, specifically focusing on upper and lower bounds for topological entropy in systems that lack uniform hyperbolicity.

Statistical Properties of Weak Horseshoes and Billiards: I plan to study the decay of correlations, limit theorems, and thermodynamic formalism for weak horseshoe examples and billiard systems. This includes analyzing how boundary geometry affects the statistical laws of motion in billiard models.
